**General Idea**  - A general description of what your software will do  
The program allows users in the same workspace to find other users with skillsets that they would like to learn more about or collaborate on a project together. The slackbot intakes basic information and skills from every user and compiles it into a database. When prompted for a certain skill in the database, the slackbot will list all users with the desired skillset and allow the user to message users with those skillsets.
​
**Anticipated Stack** - What technologies do you anticipate using?  
NodeJS
Bolt for JavaScript (Slack API)
MongoDB Atlas (Database)
​
