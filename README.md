**General Idea**
Have you ever been stuck on a project, but you didn't know where to look for help? With our Slack app, we aim to harness the collective skills and experiences of the MCIT student body so that no problem will ever go unsolved. The app will ask students to list out their unique sets of technical and creative skills, as well as their knowledge of particular industries. Then, whenever someone has a burning question about JavaScript, machine learning, graphic design, the healthcare industry, editing a cover letter, or even general organization techniques, our app will help direct their question to one of their many benevolent classmates. All from the comfort of the MCIT Slack workspace! We hope that our app will foster a greater sense of community in the MCIT program, and encourage students to be each other's greatest allies.

**Anticipated Stack**
- NodeJS
- Bolt for JavaScript (Slack API)
- MongoDB Atlas (Database)
- Heroku (NodeJS hosting)


**Functionalities**  
- Maintain a database of MCIT Slack user's skill sets based on their Slack user IDs
- Utilize the Slack API's suite of GUI elements to interact with users
- Direct questions from users towards students based on the specified topic
- Periodically suggest users with similar skill sets to have conversation
- more...
